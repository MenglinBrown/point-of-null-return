### 1. Quantitative Bidding in RTB

The bidding function depends only on the estimated utility and the cost of the ad display opportunity.

### 2. Notations and Preliminaries

Bidding function notation: \( b(r) \) returns the bid price given the estimated click-through rate (CTR) \( r \).

#### D - Data

- Bid request: Each bid request includes type, quantity, and requested attributes.
- User feedback: Feedback on how the advertisement was received by the user.
- Market price: Current market price (possibly real-time).
- Historical bidding data: Past bid data and outcomes, useful for analysis.

#### H - Hypothesis Space

- Bidding function: \( b(r) \), a function defining the bid based on the advertisement type.
- Winning probability function: \( w(b) \), probability of winning the bid.
- Utility function: \( u(r) \), the utility function from winning the bid.
- Cost function: \( c(b) \), the cost function associated with the bid.

#### F - Problem Formulation

- Single Campaign Bid Optimization: Optimizing bids based on campaign KPIs.
- Multi-Campaign Statistical Arbitrage Mining: Statistical mining across multiple campaigns.
- Budget Pacing: Managing spending rate to align with budget constraints.

### 3. Winning Probability

Probability of winning the auction as a function of bid price: \( w(b) = \int_0^b p(z) \, dz \), where \( p(z) \) is the probability density function of the market price.

#### C - Criteria

- Maximizing Campaign KPIs: Focus on enhancing key performance indicators.
- Budget Constraints: Ensuring the budget is adhered to during bidding.
- Risk Management: Managing risks associated with campaign bids.

### 4. Utility and Cost Functions

- Utility function for click number: $$u_{\text{click}}(r) = r \cdot q$$.
- Utility for campaign's profit: \( u_{\text{profit}}(x, r) = x - r \cdot v \).
- Expected cost in a first price auction: \( c_1(b) = b \cdot q \).
- Expected cost in a second price auction: \( c_2(b) = r(\min(b, p(z))) \cdot z \, dz \).

#### O - Optimization

- Truth-telling bidding: \( b_{\text{true}}(r) = vr \), where \( v \) is a constant.
- Linear bidding: \( b_{\text{lin}}(r) = \rho vr \), where \( \rho \) is a scaling factor.
- Budget constrained clicks and conversions maximization:
  $$\max_{b(\cdot)} \int_{r} u(r)w(b(r))p_r(r) \, dr$$
  subject to:
  $$
  \int_{r} c(b(r))w(b(r))p_r(r) \, dr = B
  $$
- Multi-campaign statistical arbitrage mining:
  \[
  \max_{b(\cdot),s} E[R]
  \]
  subject to:
  \[
  E[C] = B, \quad \text{Var}[R] = 1, \quad s^T1 = 1, \quad 0 \leq s \leq 1
  \]
- Budget pacing: Adjusting bid pacing to manage spending within budget.

### 5. Optimal Bidding Strategy

General form for the optimal bid price \( b^*(r) \): \( b^*(r) = b(r) \cdot \phi \), where \( \phi \) is a factor adjusted to fit market competitiveness and volume.

#### P - Prediction

- Real-Time Bidding (RTB): Predicting outcomes in real-time bidding scenarios.
- Budget Pacing: Strategically managing the spending rate to maximize effectiveness.
- Performance Evaluation: Assessing the performance of campaigns based on set metrics.

### 6. Budget-Constrained Maximization

Framework for maximizing clicks and conversions
